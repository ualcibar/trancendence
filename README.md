### Django
  Major module:
    Use a Framework as backend.
    In this major module, you are required to utilize a specific web framework for your backend development, and that framework is Django .

### AI_oponent
<a id="AIoponent"></a>
Major module:
Introduce an AI Opponent.<br>
In this major module, the objective is to incorporate an AI player into the game.
Notably, the use of the A* algorithm is not permitted for this task. Key features
and goals include:<br>

  * Develop an AI opponent that provides a challenging and engaging gameplay experience for users.
  * The AI must replicate human behavior, meaning that in your AI implementation, you must simulate keyboard input. The constraint here is that the AI can only refresh its view of the game once per second, requiring it to anticipate bounces and other actions.
  * The AI must utilize power-ups if you have chosen to implement the Game customization options module.
  * Implement AI logic and decision-making processes that enable the AI player to make intelligent and strategic moves.
  * Explore alternative algorithms and techniques to create an effective AI player without relying on A*.
  * Ensure that the AI adapts to different gameplay scenarios and user interactions.

Attention: You will need to explain in detail how your AI functions during your evaluation. Creating an AI that does nothing is strictly prohibited; it must have the capability to win occasionally.
This major module aims to enhance the game by introducing an AI opponent that adds excitement and competitiveness without relying on the A* algorithm.<br>


### GDPR
<a id="GDPR"></a>
Minor module:
GDPR Compliance Options with User Anonymization, Local
Data Management, and Account Deletion.
In this minor module, the goal is to introduce GDPR compliance options that allow

  *  Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) as an additional layer of security for user accounts, requiring users to provide a secondary verification method, such as a one-time code, in addition to their password.
  *  Utilize JSON Web Tokens (JWT) as a secure method for authentication and authorization, ensuring that user sessions and access to resources are managed securely.
  *  Provide a user-friendly setup process for enabling 2FA, with options for SMS codes, authenticator apps, or email-based verification.
  *  Ensure that JWT tokens are issued and validated securely to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive data.

This major module aims to strengthen user account security by offering Two-Factor
Authentication (2FA) and enhancing authentication and authorization through the
use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
